        # AI determines:
        - Content type (portrait, landscape, abstract, etc.)
        - Art style (anime, realistic, painting, etc.) 
        - Complexity level (simple, detailed, complex)
        - Quality requirements (speed vs quality preference)
        
    def optimize_settings(self, prompt_analysis):
        # Returns optimal: steps, guidance, scheduler, resolution
        # Based on content type and learned preferences
```

**2. Adaptive Quality Presets**
